# Camera Server Client

This is a JavaFX-based GUI for the [Raspberry Pi 5 Camera Streaming Server](https://github.com/tsitle/rpi5_camera_streaming_server).

It communicates with the server via its REST API over the network and allows the user to monitor
the camera image stream and to control most of the server's capabilities.
